                      Creating meaningful change starts within our own company.
                      Strengthening our commitment to racial equity and
                      inclusion will help Google build more helpful products for
                      our users and the world. To that end, weâre announcing
                      several commitments to build sustainable equity for our
                      Black+ community.

                          2020 was our largest year ever for hiring Black+
                          Googlers in the U.S. â both overall, and in tech
                          roles. Weâre on track to meet our goals to improve
                          leadership representation of underrepresented groups
                          by 30 percent by 2025 and more than double the number
                          of Black Googlers at all other levels by 2025.

                          We're also investing in growing Atlanta, Chicago, New
                          York and DC â locations that weâve heard from our
                          Black+ Googlers contribute to a high quality of life.
                          In 2021 so far, we've grown these sites by more than
                          650 employees. Weâre on track to meet our goals of
                          1,000 in 2021 and 10,000 by the end of 2025.

                          Weâre establishing a new talent liaison within each
                          product and functional area to mentor and advocate for
                          the progression and retention of Googlers from
                          underrepresented groups. Weâre also convening a task
                          force, including senior members of the Black+
                          community at Google, to develop concrete
                          recommendations and proposals for accountability
                          across all of the areas that affect the Black+ Googler
                          experience, from recruiting and hiring, to performance
                          management, to career progression and retention.

                        <p>
                          Weâve doubled the Retention &amp; Progression team so
                          that each organization has a designated consultant to
                          support underrepresented Googlers, and we plan to
                          triple our investment in this program by 2022.
                          Meanwhile, we continue to roll out more robust checks
                          for fairness and equity in our Perf process.

                          We continue to invest in programming that helps
                          Googlers grow and thrive at Google. This month we
                          launched a new onboarding pilot, which offers tailored
                          content to support Black employees as they begin their
                          Google career. We plan to roll the program out
                          globally by the end of the year.

                          Our internal research shows that feelings of belonging
                          are driven by many aspects of our experiences at work,
                          including the psychological safety we feel among our
                          teams, the support of our managers and leaders,
                          equitable people processes, and opportunities to grow
                          and develop our careers. Across all of these
                          dimensions, weâre committed to building more inclusive
                          practices and policiesâand revisiting them when we
                          donât get them right.

                          As one example, weâve had a security practice of
                          Googlers watching for âtailgatersâ in order to reduce
                          instances of unauthorized visitors in offices. We have
                          realized this process is susceptible to bias. So, over
                          the past year, our Global Security and Resilience team
                          partnering with a cross-functional working group,
                          conducted extensive research, listened to Black
                          Googlersâ experiences, and developed and tested new
                          security procedures to ensure we could maintain the
                          safety and security of the Google community without
                          relying on this type of enforcement. Now, as we
                          prepare to return to the office, we will end the
                          practice of Googlers badge-checking each other and
                          rely on our already robust security infrastructure.

                          Working in close consultation with our Black
                          employees, last year we introduced a student loan
                          repayment program to help Googlers build more
                          financial stability over the long term, since we know
                          that student loan debt disproportionately affects
                          women and communities of color. To date, weâve paid
                          out $3 million in student loan repayment matches.

                          And in EMEA, we've launched a new speaker
                          seriesâRE:EMEAâto localize the conversation on racial
                          equity and increase our understanding of the regionâs
                          unique history.

                          that explores systemic racism and racial

                          and inclusion into all of our flagship employee and
                          manager trainings. And moving forward, all VP+
                          performance reviews will include an evaluation of
                          leadership in support of diversity, equity and

                          Weâve worked with our mental health provider in the
                          U.S., to increase their Black network of counselors
                          from 6.6 percent to 9.8 percent and are partnering
                          with healthcare providers to create new programs for
                          concerns that disproportionately affect our Black+
                          community, to be in place by 2022. Our global EAP
                          providers are also working to further diversify their
                          network of counselors. Our Benefits team is working
                          with the Equity Project Management Office and Black
                          Leadership Advisory Group to identify areas where we
                          could expand our benefits or provide additional
                          support to Googlers and their families. As one example
                          of the kinds of programs that work: we've made the
                          medical second opinion service available to Googlersâ
                          extended familyâsomething that our Black+ community
                          told us was important to supporting a family structure
                          that includes siblings, parents, parents-in-law, and
                          grandparents.

                          makers to make changes to our computational photo
                          algorithms to address long-standing issues with how
                          digital cameras represent Black people in photos. This
                          includes auto balance adjustments to bring out natural
                          brown tones and prevent over-brightening and
                          desaturation of darker skin tones. Weâre working to

                          Birmingham, and Cleveland, to provide 50K Black-owned
                          businesses in the U.S. with the mentorship,
                          networking, and training they need to grow.

                        <p>
                          We also support Black media and creators. For example,
                          in 2020, we advertised across more than 60 Black-owned
                          media properties as part of our U.S. media spend and
                          will increase our spend on Black-owned media by 4X
                          this year. Hereâs a sample of some other initiatives
                          from the last year:
